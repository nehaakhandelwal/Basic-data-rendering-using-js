# Notes

<h5>Main.js file</h5>
<ul>
    <li> You can't use pre defined words as variable names in js (for instance, Location) </li>
    <li>USe Strict' : Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.</li>
    <li> Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.</li>
</ul>
<h5>index.html file</h5>
<ul>
    <li> OnSelect event is used for 'input type="text"' or 'textarea' </li>
    <li> OnChange is not suitable because first value will always be selected so, won't give proper result </li>
</ul>
